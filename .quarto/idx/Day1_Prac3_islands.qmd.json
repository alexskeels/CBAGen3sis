Speciation happens a bit faster in M2, and you end up with more species. Overall, however, the patterns of richness are pretty similar.

In the initialization stage we give each species a different value of it's dispersal ability and temperature width trait (niche breadth), and these are inversely related - high dispersing species have narrow niche breadths and low dispering species have wide niche breadths. This may create an interesting trade-off in dynamics of island colonization.\n\nRun the simulation\n\n```{r, eval = F}\nsim_m3 <- run_simulation(config=\"configs/config_islands_simple_Day1Prac3_M3.R\", \n                         landscape=\"data/landscapes/islands\",\n                         output_directory=\"output/islands\")\n\n```\n\nNow compare the dynamics\n\n```{r}\nsim_m3 <- readRDS(\"output/islands/config_islands_simple_Day1Prac3_M3/sgen3sis.rds\")\n\n# compare the plot summaries\nplot_summary(sim_m1)\nplot_summary(sim_m2)\nplot_summary(sim_m3)\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n# lets also compare the phylogenies\npar(mfrow=c(1,3))\nphy_m1 <- read.nexus(\"output/islands/config_islands_simple_Day1Prac3_M1/phy.nex\")\nplot(phy_m1)\nphy_m2 <- read.nexus(\"output/islands/config_islands_simple_Day1Prac3_M2/phy.nex\")\nplot(phy_m2)\nphy_m3 <- read.nexus(\"output/islands/config_islands_simple_Day1Prac3_M3/phy.nex\")\nplot(phy_m3)\n\ntrees <- list(phy_m1, phy_m2, phy_m3)\nlibrary(\"ape\")\nlapply(trees, function(x){\n  mt <- ape::balance(x)\n  mtn <- (mt[,1]-mt[,2])/max(mt)\n  hist(abs(mtn))})\n```\n\n### Exercise {.unnumbered}\n\nFrom the small tweak to the divergence factor and the initial conditions, we can see more species being generated in M2 and M3 compared to M1.

How could you test this?\n\n-   Consider how you might modify the configuration or apply it to a specific research question.\n\n-   Do you think all islands would have similar degrees of phylogenetic diversity or turnover?\n\nWe'll explore some of these questions tomorrow!\n\n## Model 4: Real👀 {.unnumbered}\n\nIf you've managed to get through all of this, run M4 config and using what you've learned, plot some of the outputs.
